	To:-habilahmed@gmail.com
        For:-bubblycoding@gmail.com

 	Dear Sir,
	I enjoy working here and appreciate the challenges that my position provides me every day.
	Though I am grateful for the professional opportunities the company offers me, I regret to tell you that my current salary doesn’t meet my expectations.
	As you know, my salary hasn’t changed since 1st March 2024.
	Therefore, the purpose of this letter is a request for a pay raise meeting.
	At this meeting, I’d be happy if we could review my performance level and discuss the salary issue.
	I strongly believe that my contribution justifies a raise in salary, because the salary level should meet the industry averages, my current competencies and performance.

	Thank you in advance,

	Yours Sincerely,

	Habil Ahmed Shaikh
	Sr. Frontend Developer
